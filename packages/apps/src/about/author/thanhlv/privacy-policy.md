# Privacy Policy

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how this website and extension handles user information and data. Our fundamental principle is simple: we do not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal data to external servers or third parties.

## Cookies and Tracking

**We use NO tracking technologies:**

- No cookies are set by this website

These logs contain no personally identifiable information and are automatically purged regularly.

## Local Processing

**Since we collect no data, there is nothing to retain or delete:**

- No user accounts or profiles exist
- No personal information is stored
- No usage history is maintained
- No data backup or archival systems contain user information

## Your Rights

**Since no personal data is collected, traditional data protection rights do not apply, but we want to be transparent:**

- Right to access: There is no data to access
- Right to deletion: There is no data to delete
- Right to portability: There is no data to port

## Security Measures

**Despite collecting no data, we maintain security best practices:**

- Encrypted connections (HTTPS) for all pages
- Secure hosting infrastructure
- Regular security audits and monitoring

## Legal Compliance

**This privacy policy complies with major privacy regulations:**

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: No personal data processing occurs
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: No personal information is collected or sold
- **Other regional privacy laws**: Our no-data approach exceeds most regulatory requirements

## Changes to This Policy

**Any changes to this privacy policy will be:**

- Posted on this page with updated date
- Highlighted if they affect our core no-data commitment
- Made only to clarify existing practices, not to introduce data collection

## Technical Implementation

**How we ensure no data collection:**

- Static website hosting with no server-side processing
- No database connections or data storage systems
- No form processing endpoints
- No API calls that transmit user data
- Regular audits of all website code and dependencies
